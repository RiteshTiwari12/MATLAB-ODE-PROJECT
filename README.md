### **# Solving ODEs with Different Numerical Methods**



*This repository contains my **final project for the MATLAB course from Internshala**. The project demonstrates solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) using multiple numerical methods and comparing them with the analytical (exact) solution.*



##### **# Project Overview**



*The goal of this project was to explore how different numerical approximation methods performed in solving the same ODE problem.*



*Implemented methods:*

	1. Euler's method.

	2. Heun's method.

	3. Runge-Kutta 4th order method.

	4. MATLAB Built-in ODE Solver(ode45).

	5. Analytical method.



*The solutions are visualized in a single graph for comparison.*



##### <b># Files in this Repository</b>



* *ode\_solver.m --> MATLAB source code containing all methods.*
* *ode\_graph.png --> Graph comparing all solutions (generated by MATLAB).*
* *README.md --> Documentation file.*



##### <b># How to run</b>



*1. clone this repository:* git clone https://github.com/RiteshTiwari12/MATLAB-ODE-PROJECT.git cd MATLAB-ODE-PROJECT	

*2. Open MATLAB and run this file:* MATLAB-ODE-PROJECT

*3. The program will:*

		i. Solve the ODE using all five methods.

		ii. Display a comparison plot.

##### <b># Learning Outcomes</b>



*From this project, I learned:*

	1. How to implement step-by-step numerical methods (Euler, Heun, Runge-Kutta).

	2. How to use MATLAB's built-in solver (ode45).

	3. The importance of step size (h) in numerical accuracy.

	4. How to compare analytical vs. numerical solutions using visual plots.

	5. Improved problem-solving and coding skills in MATLAB.
