### **# Solving ODEs with Different Numerical Methods**



*This repository contains my **final project for the MATLAB course from Internshala**. The project demonstrates solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) using multiple numerical methods and comparing them with the analytical (exact) solution.*



##### **# Project Overview**



*The goal of this project was to explore how different numerical approximation methods performed in solving the same ODE problem.*



*Implemented methods:*

	***1. Euler's method.***

	***2. Heun's method.***

	***3. Runge-Kutta 4th order method.***

	***4. MATLAB Built-in ODE Solver(ode45).***

	***5. Analytical method.***



*The solutions are visualized in a single graph for comparison.*



##### <b># Files in this Repository</b>



* *ode\_solver.m --> MATLAB source code containing all methods.*
* *ode\_graph.png --> Graph comparing all solutions (generated by MATLAB).*
* *README.md --> Documentation file.*



##### <b># How to run</b>



1. *clone this repository:*
1. 
*&nbsp;*	

*2. Open MATLAB and run this file:*



*3. The program will:*

		*i. Solve the ODE using all five methods.*

		*ii. Display a comparison plot.*

##### <b># Learning Outcomes</b>



*From this project, I learned:*

	*1. How to implement **step-by-step numerical methods** (Euler, Heun, Runge-Kutta).*

	*2. How to use **MATLAB's built-in solver** (ode45).*

	*3. The importance of **step size (h)** in numerical accuracy.*

	*4. How to compare **analytical vs. numerical solutions** using visual plots.*

	*5. Improved **problem-solving and coding skills** in MATLAB.*
